# hello-world
 Not any old repository!

I am new to github and coding, but have always loved command line! I enjoy good coffee, music and cycling. I'm from the North but currently reside in the South. Life has been an adventure thus far! I'm enjoying the journey. 

I'm sitting here with Pettywhap. Typing away at the Free Code Camp Meetup. We ate chocolate ice cream. It was delicious.
